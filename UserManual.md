# Crime Surge User Manuel

## Introduction

Welcome to the user’s manual for the Prince George’s County Crime Map Web API (PGC Crime Map). In this document you’ll find out what the site does and how to best utilize it for your needs. You’ll also find any of the bugs consistently found in the project and what to do if you encounter them. 

## Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is located at the top of the page and will remain with you as you scroll down and up the page. The bar allows you to switch between pages without having to scroll to them, giving you quick and easy access to pages and limiting the chances you’ll get lost. When at the very top of the website in the home page, the navigation bar will be clear, but it will turn a dark blue when scrolling down to the other sections of the website. 
The sections of the website are listed in order from left to right, those being: Home, About, Crime Map, Statistics, and Documentation. The bottom of the navbar of the page you’re on is highlighted at all times in a lighter blue than the one used for the navbar itself. 

## Side Bar 

The sidebar mainly pops up automatically when the window is sufficiently small, either due to being on a smaller device (e.g. a phone) or decreasing the size of your browser window.

## Home Page

The homepage is what the user sees when the CrimeSurge webpage is opened. It has a dynamic visual of traffic and a city skyline. There is a link in the center of the homepage that takes the user to our CrimeMap page. The home page is the main page of our website and with a scroll a user can see all the pages our site offers.

## About

The about page has three sections: Our Goal, About Our Dataset, and What the Dataset Will Tell Us. Our goal is to determine what types of crime occur most often in Prince George's County (PG County) and where. The About Our Dataset section describes where we got our data from and the key data points we used. The What the Dataset Will Tell Us portion describes how we used a heatmap to help users avoid areas with high crime rates.

## Crime Map

The Crime Map is a dynamic page on our site that utilizes a heatmap. It generates points on the map using latitude and longitude data. These points indicate where a crime has occured. When many points are in the same location the heat map registers a red area. When a low amount of crime occurs in an area the color is green.

## Statistics

The statistics page shows crime statistics for the PG county area. It includes dynamic graphs that update as new data is added to the dataset. This page is useful to any user looking for specific statistics on crime rates in PG county.

## Documentation

The documentation page guides users to important pages related to Crime Surge. There are three links, View Source Code, User Manual, and developers manual. The View Source code link takes the user to our Github page with all the source code. The User Manual describes our website. The Developer's manual gives developers insight on how to work with the Crime Surge site and more information about our dataset.
